# **App Name**: AdVision Dashboard

## Core Features:

- Secure Authentication: User authentication with secure login and role-based access control (admin vs. client).
- Performance Dashboard: Interactive dashboard for clients displaying key performance indicators (KPIs) such as reach, impressions, conversions, click-through rates (CTR), cost per click (CPC), and cost per mille (CPM) through charts, tables, and visualizations.
- Data Filtering: Allows clients to filter and view campaign data based on date range, platform (Facebook, Instagram), and campaign name to focus on specific data.
- Admin Panel: Administrative interface to manage ad campaigns fetched from Meta Marketing API, assign campaigns to client accounts, and manage user accounts (create, edit, archive).
- Overall Analytics View: Admin view for overall performance analytics across all clients, providing a high-level overview of campaign effectiveness and spending.
- AI Campaign Improvement: AI powered tool which uses a large language model to automatically suggest improvements for low-performing campaigns.
- Campaign Linking: Enable admins to directly link each fetched Meta campaign with the related campaign in the dashboard. This ensures the dashboard only shows campaigns admins have 'approved'.

- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font for a modern, neutral look suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use a set of consistent and professional icons that clearly represent different metrics and functionalities. The style should be simple, modern, and easily recognizable.
